/// ARMv7-M provides an interrupt controller as an integral part
/// of the ARMv7-M exception model.
///
/// The ARMv7-M NVIC architecture supports up to 496 (IRQ[495:0])
/// discrete interrupts.
///
/// All NVIC interrupts have a programmable priority value and an
/// associated exception number as part of the ARMv7-M exception
/// model and its prioritization policy.
///
/// The NVIC supports the following features:
/// -     NVIC interrupts can be enabled and disabled by writing
///       to their corresponding Interrupt Set-Enable or Interrupt
///       Clear-Enable register bit-field. The registers use a
///       write-1-to-enable and write-1-to-clear policy, both
///       registers reading back the current enabled state of the
///       corresponding (32) interrupts.
///
///       When an interrupt is disabled, interrupt assertion will
///       cause the interrupt to become Pending, however, the
///       interrupt will not activate. If an interrupt is Active
///       when it is disabled, it remains in its Active state
///       until cleared by reset or an exception return. Clearing
///       the enable bit prevents new activations of the associated
///       interrupt.
///
///       Interrupt enable bits can be hard-wired to zero where
///       the associated interrupt line does not exist, or
///       hard-wired to one where the associated interrupt
///       line cannot be disabled.
///
/// -   NVIC interrupts can be pended/un-pended using a complementary
///     pair of registers to those used to enable/disable the
///     interrupts, named the Set-Pending Register and Clear-Pending
///     Register respectively. The registers use a write-1-to-enable
///     and write-1-to-clear policy, both registers reading back the
///     current pended state of the corresponding (32) interrupts.
///     The Clear-Pending Register has no effect on the execution
///     status of an Active interrupt.
///
///     It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED for each interrupt line supported,
///     whether an interrupt supports setting and/or clearing of the
///     associated pend bit under software control.
///
/// -   Active bit status is provided to allow software to determine
///     whether an interrupt is Inactive, Active, Pending, or Active
///     and Pending.
///
/// -   NVIC interrupts are prioritized by updating an 8-bit field
///     within a 32-bit register (each register supporting four
///     interrupts). Priorities are maintained according to the ARMv7-M
///     prioritization scheme. See Exception priorities and pre-emption
///     on page B1-17.
///
/// In addition to an external hardware event or setting the appropriate
/// bit in the Set-Pending registers, an external interrupt can be pended
/// from software by writing its interrupt number (ExceptionNumber - 16)
/// to the Software Trigger Interrupt Register described in Software
/// Trigger Interrupt Register (STIR) on page B3-23.
///
/// (Excerpts from *ARMv7-M Architecture Reference Manual*,
/// chapter B3.4).
