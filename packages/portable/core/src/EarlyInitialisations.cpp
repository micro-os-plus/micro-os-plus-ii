    /// \brief Special class used to perform early initialisations and
    /// late cleanups.
    ///
    /// \details
    /// Embedded systems require some specific hardware initialisations
    /// to be performed preferably as early as possible
    /// (for example switching the clock from slow internal RC to fast
    /// external crystal). Unfortunately there is no
    /// portable method to insert initialisation code before `main()`
    /// during the startup sequence. The most portable solution is to run
    /// the hardware initialisations at the beginning of `main()`, but since
    /// in C++ static initialisers are executed before `main()`, this
    /// has the disadvantage of running the constructors before the
    /// hardware initialisations (for example at low speed).
    ///
    /// The next option is to run the initialisations
    /// during the first static constructor. C++ does guarantee that
    /// *constructors for nonlocal objects in a translation unit are executed
    /// in the order their definitions occur*. Unfortunately *no implementation
    /// independent guarantees are made about the order of construction
    /// of nonlocal objects in different compilation units* [Stroustrup,
    /// The C++ Programming Language].
    ///
    /// In real life things are not that bad, and workarounds can most of
    /// the time be imagined.
    ///
    /// For example, with the current versions of GNU GCC and LLVM CLANG,
    /// the linker builds the list of nonlocal objects constructors in the
    /// same order as it processes input object files, so by arranging that
    /// this file is encountered
    /// first, we (more or less) guarantee that the initialisation
    /// code is executed before other constructors.
    ///
    /// Symmetrically, the destructor of this class should be called
    /// after all other static destructors, to cleanup the mess and
    /// reset the platform.
    ///
    /// \note Under normal circumstances, embedded applications usually
    /// do not return from `main()`,
    /// so the static destructors are not executed; this class
    /// has a destructor for just in case, to try to recover gracefully
    /// from possible errors.
