many customisations to make it suitable for embedded environments.

The official LLVM libcxx site is available from

The original files are dual licensed under the MIT and the University of 
Illinois Open Source Licenses. As per the license requirements, the
original license text is locally available as 'LLVM libcxx License.txt'.

The live repository can be viewed at:
