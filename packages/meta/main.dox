/**

\mainpage The µOS++ SE Reference
The µOS++ SE (micro oh ɛs plus plus second edition) project is the second iteration of µOS++, a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/micro-os-plus/">SourceForge hosted</a> open source, royalty-free, multi-tasking operating system intended for 16/32/64 bit embedded systems. It is based on a simple preemptive scheduler specifically designed for ARM Cortex M devices and also ported on AVR8/AVR32 devices. Being carefully written in a subset of C++, it is elegant, convenient to use, easy to maintain, yet efficient and with a small footprint.

The authoritative µOS++ reference documents can be found in this Doxygen generated pages, with aditional documents in the project <a href="http://micro-os-plus.livius.net/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>. The source code itself, publicly available for browsing via the web <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/micro-os-plus/second/">Git Browse</a> interface is another good source of information. (Additional resources can be found in the SourceForge trackers mentioned in the Support page). The configuration metadata is documented in the <a href="http://xcdl.livius.net/wiki">XCDL wiki</a>.
