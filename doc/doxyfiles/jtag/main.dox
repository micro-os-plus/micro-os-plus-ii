\page jtag Supported JTAG probes
\tableofcontents

There are multiple JTAG probes supported for debugging <b>ÂµOS++ SE</b> 
applications, in 
fact if you already have 
a functional configuration, probably a manufacturer specific 
one, accompanied by a custom GDB server, you can continue to use it, 
but, if you start from scratch, it might be a good idea to use the
[SEGGER J-Link](http://www.segger.com/jlink.html) 
which can probably connect to any processor
you'll ever need. 
For non-commercial users there is also a more affordable version called 
[J-Link EDU](http://www.segger.com/j-link-edu.html).

If you have an unusual JTAG probe, you might also consider OpenOCD,
which is probably the most configurable multi-platform JTAG solution, but be
prepared to spend some time to tackle with the oddities of 
its extensive configuration scripts, and to the inherent 
changes and incompatibilities between versions.
