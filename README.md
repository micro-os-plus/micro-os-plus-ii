# micro-os-plus-ii

This project is the Second edition of ÂµOS++, written in 2013.

It was modularised using a structure similar to eCos, 
support for Arm Cortex-M devices was added.

An experimental build system based on Python configurations
was implemented as XCDL.

The experience with the component based configuration and build 
was considered successful, and system validated the concept.

The major weakness was the limitation to manual edits for the
build metadata, since the Python code is not easily editable
via a GUI based IDE, as are the C/C++ settings in Eclipse CDT.

The project is now archived, and preserved for historical reasons.
